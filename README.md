**MailChimp API (Example of a functional newsletter)**

With the use of API and NodeJS, I have made this program that saves E-mail information on the platform "MailChimp", this is possible because MailChimp allows users to generate API keys, and therefore use those API keys to create programs, like this one.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

**1. cd to the directory of the project and run npm install in your terminal (This will install packages in order for the project to work as intended)**

**2. before starting the server, edit the API Key in the code so you're able to test out that the newsletter retrieval works**

**3. run "nodemon" in terminal in order to start the application**

**4. Success!**
